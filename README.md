This project involves researching the Xilinx Spartan-6 LX45 FPGA card, including its design, failure mechanisms, and reliability assessment. We connected multiple FPGA cards to create a multi-component system, offering a more efficient solution for FPGA designers. The tests, programming, and simulations were conducted using the VHDL programming language, with design and implementation carried out on the Xilinx ISE platform. A key challenge during the connection of the Atlys and Basys3 FPGA cards was the significant difference in resistances. An innovative solution involved meticulously soldering 50-ohm resistors to each input of the FPGA card as impedance-matching components. Wires carefully selected for optimal signal transmission without loss or interference were connected to the resistors and systematically routed to the respective inputs on the Basys 3 Artix-7 FPGA card, ensuring precise and reliable connections.
